# Planning and Managing costs

## The pricing calculator tool

The **_Pricing Calculator_** is a tool that helps you estimate the cost of Azure products. It displays Azure products in categories, and you choose the Azure products you need and configure them according to your specific requirements. Azure then provides a detailed estimate of the costs associated with your selections and configurations.

**Note**: The pricing calculator provides estimates, **_not_** actual price quotes. Actual prices may vary depending upon the date of purchase, the payment currency you are using, and the type of Azure customer you are.

Get a new estimate from the pricing calculator by adding, removing, or reconfiguring your selected products. You also can access pricing details, product details, and documentation for each product from the pricing calculator.

The options that you can configure in the pricing calculator vary between products, but basic configuration options include:

- **_Region_**. Lists the regions from which you can provision a product. Southeast Asia, central Canada, the western United States, and Northern Europe are among the possible regions available for some resources.

- **_Tier_**. Sets the type of tier you wish to allocate to a selected resource, such as Free Tier, Basic Tier, etc.

- **_Billing Options_**. Highlights the billing options available to different types of customer and subscriptions for a chosen product.

- **_Support Options_**: Allows you to pick from included or paid support pricing options for a selected product.

- **_Programs and Offers_**. Allows you to choose from available price offerings according to your customer or subscription type.

- **_Azure Dev/Test Pricing_**. Lists the available development and test prices for a product. Dev/Test pricing applies only when you run resources within an Azure subscription that is based on a Dev/Test offer.
