### Service Lifecycle in Azure

Microsoft offer previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With **_Azure Preview Features_**, you can test beta and other prerelease features, products, services, software, and regions. Providing feedback on the features you preview also helps Microsoft improve Azure.

Azure feature previews are available under certain terms and conditions that are specific to each particular Azure preview. All preview specific terms and conditions supplement your existing service agreement, which governs your use of Azure.

**Note**: Some previews are **_not covered by customer support_**.

### Feature preview categories

The following describes the two types of Azure preview modes:

- **_Private Preview_**. This means that an Azure feature is available to **_certain_** Azure customers for evaluation purposes.
- **_Public Preview_**. This means that an Azure feature is available to **_all_** Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

**Note**: For more information about Azure Previews, refer to [Preview features](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?status=inpreview).
