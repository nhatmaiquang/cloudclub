### Service Lifecycle in Azure

## Public and private preview features

Microsoft offer previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With **_Azure Preview Features_**, you can test beta and other prerelease features, products, services, software, and regions. Providing feedback on the features you preview also helps Microsoft improve Azure.

Azure feature previews are available under certain terms and conditions that are specific to each particular Azure preview. All preview specific terms and conditions supplement your existing service agreement, which governs your use of Azure.

**Note**: Some previews are **_not covered by customer support_**.

### Feature preview categories

The following describes the two types of Azure preview modes:

- **_Private Preview_**. This means that an Azure feature is available to **_certain_** Azure customers for evaluation purposes.
- **_Public Preview_**. This means that an Azure feature is available to **_all_** Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

**Note**: For more information about Azure Previews, refer to [Preview features](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?status=inpreview).

## How to access preview features

Go to the Azure [Preview Features](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?status=inpreview) page to review a list of preview features that are available for evaluation. To preview a feature, select the **Try it** button for the applicable feature. Additionally, you can find out more information about an Azure preview feature before you try it by choosing **Learn more**.

To see which preview features you are using:

- Sign in to Azure portal
- Open the **New** blade.
- Enter the word **_preview_**.
- This displays a list of available preview features, with the word **enabled** next to each preview feature that you turn on.
- Choose **disable** to turn off a preview feature.

### Portal preview features

You can access preview features that are specific to the Azure Portal from the [Portal Preview Features](https://preview.portal.azure.com/) page. Typical portal preview features provide performance, navigation, and accessibility improvements to the Azure portal interface.

Azure customers can provide feedback on the portal preview features they've tested by **_sending a smile_** in the portal or by posting ideas and suggestions on the **_Azure Portal Feedback Forum_**. You can revert to the default Azure portal by going to the [Standard Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) page.

**Note**: For more information about Azure portal preview features, refer to [Get early access to the newest Azure portal features](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/get-early-access-to-new-portal-features-2/).

## General Availability (GA)

Once a feature is evaluated and tested successfully, it may be released to customers as part of Azure's default product, service or feature set.

In other words, the feature may be made available for all Azure customers, and a feature released to all Azure customers typically goes to **_General Availability_** or **_GA_**.

The above image outlines the general progress and process for features and bugs during product and feature development lifecycle.

**Note**: It's common for features to move from Azure preview features to GA, based on customer evaluation and feedback.
